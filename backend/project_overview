Project Overview

Core Features:

    Creature Representation:
        Genetic Code: Encode creature traits as JSON objects for easy manipulation and storage.
        Neural Network: Placeholder for neural network implementation to control creature behavior in future steps.

    Environment:
        Map: Represent the environment as a grid or continuous space in React. This map will serve as the habitat for creatures, where they move, find food, and interact.
        Food: Distribute food randomly within the environment. Creatures need to find and consume food to survive.

    Simulation Mechanics:
        Movement: Calculate creature movements based on outputs from their neural networks (to be implemented).
        Health: Implement health management where creatures lose health over time and gain health by consuming food.
        Mating and Offspring: Develop mechanisms for genetic crossover and mutation, allowing creatures to reproduce and pass on traits to offspring.

    Genetic Algorithms:
        Selection: Select creatures based on fitness for reproduction. Fitness can be determined by factors such as health, age, and food consumption.
        Crossover: Combine genetic codes of parent creatures to produce offspring with mixed traits.
        Mutation: Introduce random changes in the genetic code to promote diversity and adaptation.

    Neural Networks:
        Inputs/Outputs: Define neural network inputs (e.g., distance to food, presence of other creatures) and outputs (e.g., movement direction, speed).
        Training: Use simple heuristics or evolutionary algorithms to train the neural networks, allowing creatures to learn and adapt their behaviors over generations.
