Testing:

    Thoroughly test the current implementation to ensure all features are functioning as expected, including health management, predator-prey interactions, and visualization.

Debugging:

    Address any bugs or issues identified during testing.

Enhancements:

    Add sliders for adjusting global variables specific to predators, similar to how they are implemented for prey.
    Implement further features or improvements based on testing feedback, such as fine-tuning predator behavior and interactions.

Documentation:

    Document the changes and ensure the code is well-commented for future reference and maintenance.
