    Implemented Health Gain from Food:
        Added logic to detect when creatures are in proximity to food.
        Implemented health gain for creatures consuming food.
        Removed consumed food from the grid and respawned new food items.

    Enhanced UI Controls:
        Added buttons to start and stop the simulation.
        Simplified the UI by removing unnecessary genetic variable sliders.

    Created a Global Variables File:
        Centralized main variables such as mutation rate, eating range, food health amount, etc., into a globalVariables.js file.
        Updated App.js to use these global variables for better manageability and future adjustments.

Next Steps Outlined:

    Enhance Creature Interaction:
        Implement mating logic, genetic crossover, and mutation for offspring.
        Develop a basic neural network structure for future creature behavior control.

    Optimize Environment and Creature Behavior:
        Refine movement algorithms and health management.
        Improve decision-making strategies for finding and consuming food.

    User Interface Enhancements:
        Add control sliders for adjusting global variables dynamically.
        Introduce visual indicators to represent creature attributes such as health and strength.

    Simulation Control and Performance:
        Implement start, stop, and reset functionalities.
        Optimize performance to handle larger numbers of creatures and interactions smoothly.
