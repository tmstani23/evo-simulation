Next Steps:

    Implement Health Gain from Food:
        Detect proximity of creatures to food items.
        Increase creature health upon consuming food.
        Remove consumed food items and respawn new food in random locations.

    Reproduction Mechanics:
        Develop logic for creatures to reproduce based on specific conditions.
        Implement genetic crossover and mutation for offspring.

    Visual Enhancements:
        Add visual indicators for creature health (e.g., size or color changes).
        Enhance the visual representation of creatures and food items.

    Optimize Performance:
        Continue to optimize performance to ensure smooth simulation with a growing number of creatures.
        Investigate and apply further optimization techniques as needed.

    Simulation Controls:
        Implement controls to start, stop, and reset the simulation.
        Add options for adjusting simulation speed and parameters.

Detailed Plan for Next Step: Implement Health Gain from Food

Goal: Allow creatures to gain health when they consume food.

Sub-tasks:

    Detect Proximity to Food:
        Check if a creature is near a food item.
    Consume Food:
        Remove the food item and increase the creatureâ€™s health.
    Respawn Food:
        Randomly place a new food item in the grid after consumption.
