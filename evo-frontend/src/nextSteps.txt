Current State

    Mutation Functionality:
        The mutation button mutates the genetic code of a selected creature.
        Mutation logs show changes in the genetic code traits.

    Crossover Functionality:
        The crossover button combines genetic codes of two selected creatures to produce an offspring.
        Mutation is applied to the offspring after the crossover.
        Logs show the genetic codes of both parents, the offspring before mutation, and the offspring after mutation.

Next Steps

Here are some potential next steps to continue building your simulation:

    Health and Survival Mechanics:
        Implement health management where creatures lose health over time and gain health by consuming food.

    Environment Interaction:
        Develop the environment where creatures interact, move, and find food.

    Movement Mechanics:
        Implement movement mechanics based on outputs from the neural network.

    UI Enhancements:
        Improve the UI for better visualization and interaction with the simulation.

    Testing and Debugging:
        Continue testing the mutation and crossover functionalities to ensure they work correctly.
        Debug any issues that arise during the simulation.

Detailed Steps for Next Features
Health and Survival Mechanics

    Health Management:
        Creatures lose health over time.
        Creatures gain health by consuming food.

    Implement Food Objects:
        Add food objects to the environment that creatures can consume to restore health.

Environment Interaction

    Create an Environment Grid:
        Create a grid-based environment where creatures can move and interact with food objects.

    Implement Movement Logic:
        Allow creatures to move around the grid and find food.

UI Enhancements

    Visualization:
        Add visual elements to represent creatures and food in the environment.
        Use color coding or icons to distinguish between different creatures and food items.

    Interactions:
        Provide interactive elements for users to control the simulation (e.g., start, stop, reset).
