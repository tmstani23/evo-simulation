Next Steps for Diagnosing Issues

    Offspring Dying Immediately:
        Check Health Initialization:
            Verify that offspring health is correctly initialized and not being set to a value that causes immediate death.
        Mutation Impact:
            Ensure mutations are not causing health to drop below the threshold required for survival.

    Super Fast Offspring:
        Velocity Initialization:
            Check if offspring velocity is being correctly inherited or mutated and ensure it remains within a reasonable range.
        Mutation Impact:
            Ensure mutations to velocity are not causing unrealistic speeds.

    Direction Changes Before Hitting Walls:
        Direction Calculation:
            Verify the logic that handles direction changes to ensure it only occurs when hitting walls.
        Movement Calculation:
            Check if any part of the movement logic is causing premature direction changes.

    Parent Dying When Spawning Offspring:
        Health Deduction:
            Ensure that the parent's health is not being improperly reduced when offspring are spawned.
        Reproduction Logic:
            Review the reproduction logic to ensure it does not inadvertently impact the parent's health.

Next Steps

    Review and Debug Health Initialization:
        Add logging for health values before and after offspring are created.
        Ensure health mutations do not cause invalid health values.

    Review and Debug Velocity Initialization:
        Add logging for velocity values before and after offspring are created.
        Ensure velocity mutations do not cause unrealistic speeds.

    Review and Debug Movement and Direction Logic:
        Add logging for direction changes to understand why and when they occur.
        Ensure direction changes are only triggered by collisions with walls.

    Review and Debug Parent Health Impact During Reproduction:
        Add logging for parent health before and after offspring are spawned.
        Ensure reproduction logic does not reduce the parent's health.
