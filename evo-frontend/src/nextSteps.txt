Next Steps for Debugging and Fixing Issues

1. Debugging Clumping and Random Movement:

    Ensure Consistent Velocity and Direction: Verify that creatures maintain their inherited velocity and direction without random changes.
    Refactor Movement Logic: Ensure the calculateMovement function consistently calculates movement based on inherited properties.

2. Refactor Genetic Inheritance Functions:

    Review and Refactor crossoverGeneticCode: Ensure minimal random variation while maintaining distinct velocities for offspring.
    Verify mutateGeneticCode: Ensure mutation rates are correctly applied without causing abrupt changes.
