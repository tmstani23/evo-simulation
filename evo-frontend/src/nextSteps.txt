Test Current Functionality:

    Verify creature movement, health management, mating, and offspring generation.
    Test adjustable sliders to ensure they dynamically affect the simulation.

Add Predators to the Simulation:

    Define predator traits and behaviors.
    Implement predator generation and movement logic.
    Ensure predators hunt and eat creatures, affecting the simulation dynamics.

Enhance UI for Predators:

    Display predators on the simulation grid.
    Optionally, add UI controls to adjust predator-related variables.

Optimization and Refinement:

    Optimize the simulation for better performance.
    Refine the health and survival mechanics for both creatures and predators.
    Ensure smooth and realistic interactions within the environment.

Continuous Testing and Debugging:

    Regularly test all functionalities to ensure everything works seamlessly.
    Debug any issues that arise to maintain a smooth simulation experience.
