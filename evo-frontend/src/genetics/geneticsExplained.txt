 Creature Behavior in the Simulation

    Movement: Creatures move around the screen based on their genetic code, which includes traits like speed and direction.
    Health: Creatures lose health over time but can regain health by eating food that appears randomly in the environment.
    Reproduction: When certain conditions are met, creatures can reproduce and create offspring.

**2. Conditions for Reproduction

    Reproduction Rate: Each creature has a small chance of attempting to reproduce at each step of the simulation. This is determined by a probability value (e.g., 0.004 for prey).

**3. Attempting Reproduction

    Selecting a Mate: If a creature attempts to reproduce, it selects another creature at random from the population to be its mate.
    Combining Genetic Codes: The genetic codes of the two parent creatures are combined to create a new genetic code for the offspring. This process is called "crossover."
        Crossover: Traits from both parents are mixed, so the offspring inherits characteristics from both.
        Mutation: After crossover, the offspring's genetic code might undergo slight random changes, called mutations, to introduce variation.

**4. Creating the Offspring

    Positioning: The offspring is placed near the parent creature in the environment, within a small radius.
    Adding to Population: The new creature (offspring) is added to the population and will behave like any other creature in the simulation.

**5. Health and Survival

    Initial Health: The offspring starts with a health value based on its genetic code.
    Lifecycle: Like all creatures, the offspring will move around, lose health over time, eat food to survive, and eventually may reproduce, continuing the cycle.
