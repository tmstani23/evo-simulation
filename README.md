# Creature Simulation

This project is a creature simulation where virtual creatures move within a grid environment. The simulation includes basic mechanics for movement, health management, and genetic variables.

## Features

- **Grid Environment:** A fixed-size grid where creatures move, find food, and interact.
- **Creature Initialization:** Creatures are initialized with genetic codes that determine their attributes such as health, speed, and direction.
- **Movement Mechanics:** Creatures move within the grid based on their genetic attributes. They bounce back upon hitting grid boundaries.
- **Health Management:** Creatures lose health over time and can be removed from the grid when their health reaches zero.
- **Mutation Sliders:** Real-time sliders allow adjustment of genetic variables affecting the creatures.
